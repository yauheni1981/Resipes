Do you need a cookbook?
When you come across interesting recipes on the Internet, you think: "Oh, cool! Be sure to cook," and safely forget about them
The cookbook that you inherited is already pretty battered and falling apart.
You like to experiment in the kitchen and come up with your own recipes.
You are constantly writing down your favorite recipes on pieces of paper and losing them.
You have a secret passion for organizing data.
You regularly call your mom to find out how a particular dish is being prepared.
You know hundreds of little tricks that help to improve the taste of dishes.
If at least a couple of points coincide with your reality, the cookbook will definitely come in handy.
